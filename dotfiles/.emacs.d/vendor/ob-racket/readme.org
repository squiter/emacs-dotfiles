#+title: Org Babel support for Racket
#+startup: showeverything
#+options: todo:t

Run Racket code blocks within Org mode buffers:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
,#+BEGIN_SRC racket
#lang racket

(printf "Hello World")
,#+END_SRC

,#+RESULTS:
: Hello World
#+END_SRC

**** Features/Status

***** DONE ~:results output~

Simplest case of running a code block is supported :)

***** DONE ~:lang racket~

It is possible to set the racket language to be used within the buffer
by setting ~:lang~.  This can be useful to set the lang to be used
throughout the same Org buffer by setting a global property:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
,#+property: header-args :lang racket

,#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(printf "Hello world")
,#+END_SRC

,#+RESULTS:
: Hello world
#+END_SRC

***** TODO ~:var params~

Tables and variable passing via =:var= not supported yet.

**** Installation

- Get Racket mode
- Enable Racket code blocks execution and path to racket binary

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages
      'org-babel-load-languages
      '((racket . t)))

(setq org-babel-racket-command "/usr/local/bin/racket")
  #+END_SRC

- Put =ob-racket.el= within the =contrib/lisp/= folder of your Org mode distribution

- That should be it :)
