*** DONE Support automatic =#lang= insertion

Most of the time ~#lang racket~ has to be inserted in the block. It
would be convenient to have it be done in the background, and have
this deactivated

**** Default

Default parameter is ~lang~:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang racket
(printf "hello world")
#+END_SRC

**** Avoid affecting tangle

For this, something like the following could be done.

#+property: header-args :lang nil

So that lang is not inserted and handled manually as usual.
