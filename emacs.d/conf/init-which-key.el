;;; Code:
(use-package which-key
  :init

  ;; TODO: this settings seems to not work
  (setq which-key-paging-prefixes '("C-x"))
  (setq which-key-paging-key "<f5>")

  ;; Set the time delay (in seconds) for the which-key popup to appear.
  (setq which-key-idle-delay 0.7)

  ;; Set the separator used between keys and descriptions. Change this setting to
  ;; an ASCII character if your font does not show the default arrow. The second
  ;; setting here allows for extra padding for Unicode characters. which-key uses
  ;; characters as a means of width measurement, so wide Unicode characters can
  ;; throw off the calculation.
  (setq which-key-separator " â†’ " )
  (setq which-key-unicode-correction 3)

  ;; Set to t to show the count of keys shown vs. total keys in the mode line.
  (setq which-key-show-remaining-keys t)

  :config (which-key-mode))

(provide 'init-which-key)
;;; init-which-key.el ends here
