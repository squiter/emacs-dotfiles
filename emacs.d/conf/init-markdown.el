;;; Commentary:
;;
;; In this repo we add `markdown-mode+' that adds some features up the
;; `markdown-mode'

;;; Code:

(autoload 'markdown-mode "markdown-mode"
   "Major mode for editing Markdown files" t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.text\\'" . markdown-mode))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.markdown\\'" . markdown-mode))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.md\\'" . markdown-mode))

(use-package grip-mode
  :bind (:map markdown-mode-command-map
         ("g" . grip-mode)))

;; This package doesn't work on OSX because vmd was abandoned
;; (use-package vmd-mode :commands vmd-mode)

(provide 'init-markdown)
;;; init-markdown.el ends here
